# Minimax-Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a tic tac toe made in the Python Programming Language using the Minimax Algorithm.

To open the game, download the 2 python files and run "main.py".

You will should see the current tic tac toe board (which, in this case, should be empty) and a prompt asking you to enter a number.

Each number corresponds to a specific place in the board:

1 | 2 | 3

4 | 5 | 6

7 | 8 | 9 

Enter the number you want and wait for the opponent to play. After that, the game continues in the same way.
The game ends when one of the players win or there is a tie. The results of the game will be printed out in the console.
